# Adventure Module Asset Importer for Foundry VTT

This tool for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) (no affiliation) allows you to import any assets (such as images, audio files, etc.) from other modules into your adventure module.\
This has been built in a hurry and is by no means meant for the public.

Note that while it's possible to releases for multiple operating systems, I'm only providing the app (installation or portable) for Windows so far.

It's built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and leverages the official Foundry VTT CLI to edit the adventure module.

## Usage

I'm too tired to write a manual at the moment. Just note that to be safe, you should always create a copy of your module directory (the directory for your adventure module, not your `modules` directory) before using this tool to modify it.
