# Adventure Module Asset Importer for Foundry VTT

This tool for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) (no affiliation) allows you to import any assets (such as images, audio files, etc.) from other modules into your adventure module.\
To be safe, please always create a copy of your module directory before using this tool to modify it.

It's built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and leverages the official Foundry VTT CLI to edit the adventure module.
